# descenders-terrain-texture-detector
This is for unity 2017 and will allow you to easily replace texture terrains, expand them all with a live preview and backup of original terrain


To install  copy  TerrainTextureDetector.cs into your Assets/Editor folder   make sure Editor is capitalized.
goto Tools - Terrain Texture Detector

select your terrain, choose which texture you want to find its boundaries and click detect texture boundaries
then choose what texture you want to replace it with or use the same as you have to expand the size of it
use live preview to see where the yellow lines/dots are to know which terrain areas will be changed.

it automatically makes a backup of your terrain and gives a restore button if you dont like what occurred.
as always, backup your project file first before testing.  YOU ONLY HAVE 1 RESTORE POINT so USE IT if you want to go back to previous terrain

**NOTES<br><br>
 *YOU ONLY HAVE 1 RESTORE POINT so USE IT if you want to go back to previous terrain<br>
 *The larger the expansion the longer it may take to process in unity, be patient.<br><br>
